##NOTE!
This is a first draft, feel free to create pull requests. Might have a lot of bugs so be careful with the usage!

##Example
I would like to have a News Resource. I want to have all the CRUD functionality for it. So instead of creating all the Stuff by hand, i can use `php artisan make:resource news` to generate all the necessary stuff:

```bash
$> php artisan make:resource news
Model created successfully.
Created Migration: 2015_04_17_083658_create_news_table
Seed created successfully.
Request created successfully.
Controller created successfully.
Views created successfully.
```
